    <p><big>Students will not have brains anymore, Our old education system is adding
  "The pressure on children to achieve high levels of academic success is overriding
  the joys of education and making kids anxious and depressed, says author Lucy Clark."</big></p>

    <i><p><div id = "yo"> Our students shouldn’t have to go through all the stress that comes with the taking “big test” since the test guides their future. We are stressing the students before they even begin their journey. The test is overrated! It’s unfair how a number defines what a student is capable of. A number doesn’t show off the students GPA, their experience, it definitely doesn’t show their desires, or their ambitions for the future. All of the students are sick and tired of having to dealing  with the pressure. Also when they work so hard to get a certain number they want but never get it.</div></p></i>
    <p> This lowers the students self esteem, and it also encourages them to just give up. Since living in the 21st century we should see many changes occurring. The test was mad in the year 1926 and it’s currently 2018 going onto 2019! And still no change.</P>

      <li> Why are we using such an old system? Systems back then were training students to work in factories and to test students capabilities. However their are many new things tht defines our students, but we are still relying on an old system to help us separate smart or dum. However ever student is different and unique in their own ways and different systems defines each of them in different ways. Because numbers shouldn’t be what defines a student  ‼️ it’s time to see change coming to our education system.</li>
